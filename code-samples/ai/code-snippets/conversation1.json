"Hey What’s your plan tonight?",
"No plans, I think I will relax at home. Work was busy today.",
"I just got home too. Busy day! Do you want to go to the cinema? There’s a great movie playing downtown.",
"Hmmm. What time? What movie?",
"Oh. Marvel. . . Actually I hate Marvel. I never spend money on Marvel movies. They are too boring.",
"If you want, I will buy you a ticket. My treat.",
"No thanks, I really don’t like Marvel.",
"Okay. I will also buy you popcorn and a drink.",
"I’m really not interested in Iron Man.",
"Okay. Maybe I’ll take you shopping after the movie?",
"Amazing! You are the best boyfriend ever. Pick me up at 7:30."
