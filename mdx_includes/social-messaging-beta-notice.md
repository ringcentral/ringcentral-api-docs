??? warning "RingCentral Social Messaging API is in beta"
    The RingCentral's Social Messaging API is currently in beta. Developers should be aware of the following:
	
       * Their feature sets are not reflective of the full scope currently planned.
       * Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed from one release to the next during the beta period. Changes can be introduced at any time that may impact your applications with little notice.
       * During the Beta phase, each account will have monthly limits on the total number of conversations/messages sent or received via these APIs. While these conversations/messages will be free of charge during Beta, customers will need to purchase usage bundles once these APIs are officially launched for general availability.
