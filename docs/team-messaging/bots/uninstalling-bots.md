# Uninstalling and removing bots from an account

## Uninstalling bots via the App Gallery

Any user can view a list of the bots that are currently installed in their account by visiting the [web-based App Gallery](https://ringcentral.com/apps/my-apps) and by visiting the "Installed apps" tab. All installed bots will be listed under the Bots header.

Users that have the "Remove bots" permission assigned to them via their role in the [Admin Console](https://service.ringcentral.com/) will see a "Remove" button.
