# Call Queues

Call Queues are a poplar way to have multiple people respond to incoming calls. They are a useful way for example to create a department of people that all respond when a call is directed to the same extension. 

They work by assigning a number of extensions to a call queue grouping. The call queue grouping has an extension of its own. When a call is directed to the queue's extension, the call is connected with the first extension in the queue that is available. If a call is directed to an extension via the queue, and the receiving extension fails to answer, the call will be directed to that extension's voice mail. The call will *not* re-enter the queue. 

## Create a Call Queue

Creating a call queue is performed in the [Online Account Portal](https://service.ringcentral.com) under groups.

## Read Call Queue List

The List Extensions endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of call queues, known as departments via the API.

## Read User Queue Agent Presence

A user extension's actual presence status is determined by aggregating a number of different presence statuses including `dndStatus`, `telephonyStatus` and `userStatus`. These and the aggregate presence, `presenceStatus` are available in the presence endpoint.

A user extension's queue agent status is set by the extension presence `dndStatus` property. This can be set to one of four values:

1. `TakeAllCalls`
1. `DoNotAcceptAnyCalls`
1. `DoNotAcceptDepartmentCalls`
1. `TakeDepartmentCallsOnly`

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `v1.0/account/{accountId}/extension/{extensionId}/presence` | Read extension presence |

**Sample Response**

```json
{
  "uri" : "https.../restapi/v1.0/account/11111111/extension/11112222/presence",
  "extension" : {
    "uri" : "https.../restapi/v1.0/account/11111111/extension/11112222",
    "id" : 11112222,
    "extensionNumber" : "101"
  },
  "presenceStatus" : "Available",
  "telephonyStatus" : "NoCall",
  "userStatus" : "Available",
  "dndStatus" : "TakeAllCalls",
  "message" : "Hello, World",
  "allowSeeMyPresence" : true,
  "ringOnMonitoredCall" : false,
  "pickUpCallsOnHold" : false
}
```

## Update User Queue Agent Presence

To enable or disable an user extension's queue agent presence, update the extension's presence `dndStatus` property.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `PUT` | `v1.0/account/{accountId}/extension/{extensionId}/presence` | Update extension presence |

```json
{
  "dndStatus": "DoNotAcceptDepartmentCalls"
}
```

## Subscribe for Presence Notification Events

You can receive events about presence changes to an extension by subscribing to extension specific presence information using an event filter. To learn more, consult our documentation relating to our [Presence API](../../../voice/presence/).
