# Making your first REST API call on RingCentral

Congratulations on starting your journey with the RingCentral Developer Platform!

As you begin building your application or integration, there are a few key concepts and tools you’ll want to get familiar with. To set you up for success, we’ve created a comprehensive Getting Started Guide designed specifically for developers like you.

If you’re new to the platform or have never built a RingCentral application before, we highly recommend starting here. It’s the fastest way to learn the essentials and make your first API call with confidence.

## What You’ll Learn in the Getting Started Guide

The RingCentral Getting Started Guide is designed to help developers build a strong foundation. By the end of this experience, you’ll be able to:

* **Register an Application**: Obtain the necessary app credentials to interact with the RingCentral API.
* **Generate Authentication Credentials**: Learn how to authenticate and securely log in to make API calls.
* **Make Your First API Call**: Use simple sample apps to send real API requests and see how everything works in action.

## What’s Next?

Once you’ve successfully made your first API call with our sample app, return to this guide to continue your developer journey.

In the next sections, we’ll take a deeper dive into the core fundamentals of the RingCentral platform, guiding you through the process of building your first custom app. We’ll start by exploring how to register an app and obtain credentials—the first step in creating your own integration.
