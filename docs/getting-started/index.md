# Making your first API call on RingCentral

Congratulations on taking your first steps towards building an application or integration with the RingCentral Developer Platform. There are a number of things you will need to become familiar with in order to build with us. To help you get started successfully, we have provided developers with a guides getting started experience. If you are new to the platform, or have not yet built an application yourself, we recommend you get started here.

## What you will learn in the getting started experience

The RingCentral getting started experience will help developers successfully do the following:

* **Setup a sandbox account** for testing and development
* **Register an application** to obtain app credentials
* **Generate an auth credential** to login into the API and make API calls
* **Call the API** using simple sample apps

## When you are finished...

Once you have successfully called the RingCentral API using the sample app we have provided, return to this guide to continue your learning journey on the platform. In the sections that follow, we will take a deeper dive into all of the fundamentals of the RingCentral platform to help you get up and running builing your first custom app on the platform. We will begin that journey by learning how to register an app to obtain credentials for that app.
