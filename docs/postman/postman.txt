# Using Postman to test RingEX APIs

For easy testing using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), RingCentral provides a Postman 2.0 Collection for Enhanced Business SMS. If you use Postman, the we recommend using the collection as it provides authorization handling using Postman variables and environments as recommended by Postman.

The collection is available here:

* [Postman 2.1 Collection](https://www.postman.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-platfom-public)

This document describes how to install and use the Postman 2.1 Collection.

## Pre-Requisites

## Using Postman

Using Postman once you have your pre-requisites consists of a few steps:

## Configuring Your Postman Environment

| Variable                        | Description                                                           |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`RINGCENTRAL_SERVER_URL`**    | RingCentral's API URL which would be https://platform.ringcentral.com |
| **`RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID`**     | Application's Client ID                                               |
| **`RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET`** | Application's Client Secret                                           |
| **`RINGCENTRAL_JWT`**           | RingCentral user's JWT token from User's Profile -> Credentials       |

### Making an API call

To test the Postman collection, let's call the "Send SMS" API.

1. In the Environments pick list in the upper right corner, select the environment you just created.
1. In the left hand navigation menu, select "Auth" > "Auth via JWT Flow."
1. Clicking on the "Send" button will run the "Pre-request Script" followed by API call, and then will load the `access_token` in `my_access_token` environment variable. You do not need to do anything with this token.
1. Navigate to "APIs" > "Send SMS" and click "Send".

If all your environment variables are set properly, you will be able to see the SMS sent out successfully.
Follow this up by trying "Send MMS" API.
