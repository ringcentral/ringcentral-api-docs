# Webhook Notifications Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you create a Webhook push notifications app using our Push Notifications API, which allows your application receiving notifications on instant SMS message events. Let's get started.

## Create an app and obtain credentials

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Console. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Notifications App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "REST API App" under "What type of app are you creating?" Click "Next."</li>
<li>Under "Auth" select "JWT auth flow"
<li>Under "Security" add the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>WebSocket Subscriptions, Read Presence</li>
    <li>SMS</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Download and edit a `.env` file

Follow the instructions found in our guide to [running Developer Guide code samples](../../basics/code-samples.md). Or:

1. Download our [env-template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-api-docs/main/code-samples/env-template) and save it as a file named `.env`.
2. Edit your newly downloaded `.env` file, setting its variables with the proper values for the app you created above.
     * `RC_APP_CLIENT_ID` - set to the Client ID of the app you created above
     * `RC_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` - set to the Client Secret of the app you created above
     * `RC_USER_JWT` - set to the [JWT credential you created](../../getting-started/create-credential.md) for yourself
     * `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_ADDRESS` - the full address where notifications will be sent to. If you run the code on your local machine, you can use ngrok service to obtain a tunnel address to your localhost. E.g. https://1058-69-181-202-2.ngrok-free.app

=== "Java"

    ### Create a WebhookServer project (using Eclipse IDE)

    * Create a new Java project
    * Select the Gradle Project wizard
    * Enter project name "WebhookServer"
    * Open the <tt>build.gradle</tt> file and add the dependencies to the project as shown below:

    ```json
    dependencies {
        // ...
        implementation 'org.eclipse.jetty.aggregate:jetty-all:9.4.51.v20230217'
        implementation: 'javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:4.0.1'
    }
    ```
    We use jetty-all version 9.4.x for our server. You can get a different version [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jetty.aggregate/jetty-all) if you want to.

    ### Create a new Java Class

    Select "File -> New -> Class" to create a new Java class named "WebhookServer"

    Edit the `WebhookServer.java` with code below:

    ```Java
    {!> code-samples/webhooks/WebhookServer.java !}
    ```

    ### Create a Java project (using Eclipse IDE)

    * Create a new Java project
    * Select the Gradle Project wizard
    * Enter project name "WebHookNotification"
    * Open the <tt>build.gradle</tt> file and add the RingCentral Java SDK to the project as shown below:

    ```json
    dependencies {
        // ...
        compile 'com.ringcentral:ringcentral:3.0.0'
    }
    ```

    * On Eclipse menu, select "Run" and choose the "Run Configurations" and in the dialog, select your project and select the "Environments" tab then enter the following variables:
        - RC_APP_CLIENT_ID
        - RC_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
        - RC_SERVER_URL
        - RC_USER_JWT
        - WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_ADDRESS

    * Right-click the project in the Package Explorer and choose "Refresh Gradle Project" under the "Gradle" sub-menu

    ### Create a new Java Class

    Select "File -> New -> Class" to create a new Java class named "WebHookNotification"

    ```java
    package WebHookNotification;

    public class WebHookNotification {

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

      }
    }
    ```

    ### Edit the file "WebHookNotification.java".

    Run ngrok to create a localhost tunnel

    ```bash
    $ ngrok http 5000
    ```

    Copy the forwarding address, e.g. https://1058-69-181-202-32.ngrok-free.app, and paste it to your .env file. Or paste it directly into the DELIVERY_ADDRESS variable in the code below.

    ```java
    {!> code-samples/webhooks/WebhookNotification.java !}
    ```

    Now first run the WebhookServer app, then run the WebHookNotification app from Eclipse.

### Test the app

* Now you can send an SMS message to the extension's phone number to see how you'll receive the notification.
* After testing your webhook subscription creation, feel free to edit the <tt>webhook-notification.xx</tt> file by comment out the `subscribe_for_notification()` function call and uncomment the next line `read_subscriptions()` to test reading and deleting subscriptions.
