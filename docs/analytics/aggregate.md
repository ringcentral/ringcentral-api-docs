# Obtaining Aggregate Call Business Analytics Data

!!! warning "Analytics API - breaking change alert!"
    Analytics API aggregate path has changed to `POST /analytics/calls/v1/accounts/~/aggregation/fetch`

It is quite common to acquire and segment call related data for reporting or analysis. Call Aggregate API provides the ability to aggregate call related data in various ways such as by summing, averaging, getting minimum or maximum or percentage of data etc. Line of business managers can make incentive, allocation, or training decisions by looking at total answered calls vs not answered calls per agent, or by looking at the average abandonment rate for an agent, or by checking the total handle time for each agent.

Example Use Cases:

- How many calls are being answered over a particular period?
- What does the abandonment rate look like?

For more information, please refer to the [overview section](index.md).

## Composing a request using RingCentral API Reference

One can use our [interactive API Reference](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Business-Analytics/analyticsCallsAggregationFetch) to not only create API Request but also run it interactively and see the response.

## API Definition Guide

### Controlling what to group data by

There are two options to group by. The `groupBy` element allows users to perform direct grouping. The `groupByMembers` element allows users to group by individual users with the selected option.  All the data retrieved will represent the portion of the calls that involved the specified `groupBy` or `groupByMember` type. GroupBy types cannot be mixed in one request, there can only be one type.  If this field is undefined or null, the response will contain one record with data aggregated by the whole company.

#### Direct Grouping (groupBy)

|groupBy (API)	| Description |
|---|---|
| `Company` | This grouping will return call data for the entire company. |
| `CompanyNumbers` | This grouping will return call data for direct numbers set up under Phone Systems - > Phone Numbers on Admin Portal. |
| `Users` | This grouping will return call data for individual mailboxes. When users are added to the grouping, the response provides call data aggregated at the user level.  |
| `Queues` | This grouping will return call data for Queue extensions. |
| `IVRs` | This grouping will return call data for IVR extensions. |
| `SharedLines` | This grouping will return Call data for the calls made to one phone number that can be answered by up to 16 phones within a designated group. |
| `UserGroups` | This grouping will return call data for  User Groups setup on Admin Portal. |
| `Sites` | This grouping will return call data for Site extensions when an account is using the multi-site feature. |
| `Departments` | This grouping will return call data for users labeled with the same Department on Admin Portal. |

#### Group by Memebers (groupByMembers)

|groupByMember (API)	| Description |
|---|---|
| `Department` | This grouping will return call data for individual users under Departments. Specify Ids of departments along with this grouping which will provide aggregated call data for users under those departments. |
| `UserGroup` | This grouping will return call data for individual users under User Groups. Specify Ids of user groups along with this grouping which will provide aggregated call data for users under those user groups. |
| `Queue` | This grouping will return call data for individual users under Queues. Specify Ids of queues along with this grouping which will provide aggregated call data for users under those queues.
| `Site` | This grouping will return call data for individual users under Sites. Specify Ids of Sites along with this grouping which will provide aggregated call data for users under those Sites. |

**Example**

```json
"grouping": {
  "groupBy": "Users",
  "keys": []
}

or

"grouping": {
  "groupByMember": "Site",
  "keys": []
}
```

### Setting the timeframe of the request

The `timeSettings` object contains the following important elements:

* The `timeZone` will be used to determine the `includeDays` and `includeHours` specified in the `advancedTimeSettings`
* The `timeRange` element allows users to specify the datetime range for which the calls will be aggregated and will be provided in set time intervals (for example day, week etc). The call is considered to be within time range if it was started within that range. This is similar to aggregate endpoint along with providing data at different timeframe splits.
* The `advancedTimeSettings` gives you even more flexibility in including and excluding data from generated reports, including the ability to include/exclude weekdays and set the timezone and working hours.

In the below example, under `advancedTimeSettings`, the `includeDays` will allow users to add weekdays of choice, and `includeHours` will allow users to filter data for custom hours (format hh:mm) for specified date-time range under `timeRange` section. Further, they can add `grouping` as necessary to make sure that the data received is aggregated by counter & timer.

**Example**

```json
"timeSettings": {
  "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles",
  "timeRange": {
    "timeFrom": "2021-10-02T00:00:00.877Z",
    "timeTo": "2022-01-02T04:01:33.877Z"
  },
  "advancedTimeSettings": {
    "includeDays": [
      "Sunday"
    ],
    "includeHours": [
      {
        "from": "00:00",
        "to": "23:59"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Customizing Data Response

The `responseOptions` element allows users to specify call aggregation breakdown and its data aggregation types for API response. These response options will get sliced and diced by using the additional filters section in the API request.

The `counters` element provides aggregation on Call volume by specified metrics. The metrics can be provided in the counter section under the response option. Every response section has an option to specify aggregation type & Interval. The supported types are Sum, Average, Min, Max, Percent, and Interval is Hour, Day, Week, Month.

**Example**

```json
"responseOptions": {
  "counters": {
    "allCalls": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "queueOpportunities": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "callsByDirection": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "callsByOrigin": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "callsByResponse": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "callsSegments": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    }
    /* snip */
  }
}
```

The `timers` element provides aggregation for time spent on the call. The metrics can be provided in the timer section under the response option which will provide duration details. Every response section has an option to specify aggregation type & Interval. The supported types are Sum, Average, Min, Max, Percent and Interval is Hour, Day, Week, Month.

**Example**

```json
"responseOptions": {
  "timers": {
    "allCallsDuration": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "callsDurationByDirection": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "callsDurationByOrigin": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "callsDurationByResponse": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    },
    "callsSegmentsDuration": {
      "aggregationType": "Sum"
    }
    /* snip */
  }
}
```

### Filtering your dataset even more

The `callFilters` element allows users to filter out the data and specify the granular scope to call breakdown metrics for both `counter` and `timer` section. Detailed splits of these sections can be found in Data Dictionary below.

| `callResponses` | array[string] | Aggregation of calls by the first response action. |
| `callResults` | array[string] | Aggregation of calls by the nature of call result. |
| `callSegments` | array[object] | Aggregation of calls by the presence of specific segment. Example: `hold`, `park`, or `transfer`. |

### Pagination

Analytics can produce a lot of results so you may want to paginate your results to enable easier processing. Pagination is done with two additional query parameters: `page` and `perPage`

| Pagination (API) | Description |
|-|-|
| `page` | The page you wish to start with. For example, start on page 2. |
| `perPage` | The number of results return on each page. For example, you want 10 results on the first page and an additional 10 on the second page. Note: aggregate reports have a max limit of `200` per page. |

**Example**

``` http
POST /analytics/calls/v1/accounts/~/aggregation/fetch?page=2&perPage=10
Host: platform.ringcentral.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_VALID_ACCESS_TOKEN
