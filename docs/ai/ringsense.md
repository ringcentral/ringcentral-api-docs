# RingSense

{! mdx_includes/ringsense-beta-notice.md !}

RingCentral RingSense transcribes your voice calls and provides in-depth conversational insights, offering detailed analytics derived from post-call analysis of recorded sessions. Based on the richness of the conversation content, the insights may include the following:

* `Transcript` - Transcription objects with identified speakers and the timestamps of their utterances.
* `Summary` - Summary objects with AI-generated summary paragraphs and the timestamps of the conversations.
* `HighLights` - Highlight objects contain speaker utterances that capture key points, valuable insights, and notable moments for quick review and analysis.
* `NextSteps` - Next steps objects contain AI-generated action items for the call participants.

!!! important Requirements
    * A RingSense license must be purchased and assigned to a user extension.
    * The license is transferable from one user extension to another user extension.
    * RingSense data retention is defined in your RingSense settings. By default the data is retained for 1 year.

To learn more about RingSense and how to enable the service for a RingCentral RingEX account, please refer to this [online article](https://www.ringcentral.com/ringsense-for-sales.html).

## RingSense API

The RingSense API allows you to programmatically access RingSense data from your account.

!!! notes
    * Currently the API does not support video meeting recordings.

The API functions at the account level and requires the "ReadCompanyCallRecording" user permission. This means that any user extension with this permission can access RingSense data for any user holding a RingSense license.

There are two methods to access RingSense data: through push notifications (recommended method) or via a REST API call.

### RingSense event notification

You can get notified when a new voice call recording analysis is completed via [RingCentral push notification  service](../notifications/index.md). The RingSense data is included in the event payload together with the event metadata.

To receive RingSense event notification for voice call recordings, [subscribe for this event](../notifications/event-filters/ringsense-event-filter.md).

Remember, the notification events are triggered only if a voice call was recorded by users who hold a RingSense license.

### Read RingSense data

You can read the RingSense data of a voice call recording if you know the `sourceRecordId`. The `sourceRecordId` value of a recording is included in the RingSense event payload.

!!! notes
    * The `sourceRecordId` of a voice call recording is the recording ID of a recorded call. You can get the recording ID of a call from the [call log data](../voice/call-log/details.md).

## Example of API Response

```json
{!> code-samples/ai/ringsense/ringsense-data.json !}
```

| Parameter	| Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | For voice calls, the system uses the the caller and callee name to compose the title. |
| `domain` | String | Name of the communication medium. Currently only for voice calls ('pbx') are supported. |
| `sourceRecordId` | String | The value is the call recording ID (can be retrieved from the call log).  |
| `sourceSessionId` | String | The value is the call telephony session id. |
| `callDirection` | String | For voice calls only. The value is either `Inbound` or `Outbound`.  |
| `ownerExtensionId` | String | The extension ID of the user who holds the RingSense license.  |
| `recordingDurationMs` | Integer | The length of the voice call recording.  |
| `recordingStartTime` | String | The date and time when the recording started.  |
| `creationTime` | String | The date and time when the conversational insights are created. |
| `lastModifiedTime` | String | The date and time when the conversational insights are last modified. |
| `speakerInfo` | List | Contains identified call participant objects.  |
| `insights` | JSON object | Contains call conversational insights data objects. |

### SpeakerInfo

The `speakerInfo` is a list of objects, with each object contains the following key/value pairs:

| Parameter     | Type     | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------   | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `speakerId`   | String   | System given speaker identifier. For voice calls, the ID is the call party ID assigned by the telephony system.  |
| `name`        | String   | The name of a participant. If the speaker is an agent (a user under the account), the name is the full name of the user extension. If the speaker is a call party outside of the account, the name is the specified name of the contact associated with the agent company or personal contacts. |
| `accountId`   | String   | The ID of the RingCentral account. If the speaker is a call party outside of the account, this value is `null`.  |
| `extensionId` | String   | The ID of the user extension. If the speaker is a call party outside of the account, this value is `null`.      |

### Insights

The `insights` is an object that may contain the following objects:

| Parameter     | Type   | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Transcript`  | List   | A list of JSON objects. Each object contains transcribed texts and related metadata.    |
| `Summary`     | List   | A list of JSON objects. Each object contains the summary value and related metadata.    |
| `HighLights`  | List   | A list of JSON objects. Each object contains the highlight value and related metadata.  |
| `NextSteps`   | List   | A list of JSON objects. Each object contains the next step value and related metadata.  |

When processing the insights objectsâ€”such as reconstructing conversations using the utterances in the `Transcript` objects, you can match the speaker ID from a transcript object with the corresponding speaker ID in the `speakerInfo` object. This allows you to display the speaker's name (if available) alongside the utterance text.
