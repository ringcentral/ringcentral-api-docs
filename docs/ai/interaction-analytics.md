# Extract interaction analytics from a media file

Interaction analytics is used to understand a conversation happening in a meeting between two or more people and extract from them more meaningful insights at scale. This API is a comprehensive in that in addition to its unique capabilities, it also bundles functionality found in our other APIs. In processing a media file, this API will provide multiple levels of insights, including:

* Conversation insights
    * [transcription](speech-to-text.md) with [smart punctuation](text-punctuation.md)
    * [content summaries](text-summary.md)
    * keywords and conversation metrics
* Speaker-level insights
    * [speaker diarization](speaker-diarization.md)
    * [speaker identification](speaker-identification.md)
* Utterance-level insights
    * emotion recognition

Let's say we want to analyze a meeting between a sales representative and a customer, and that meeting lasted for twenty minutes. Here are some of the insights we can extract using this API:

* Speaker talking time, e.g. a sales representative spoke for ten minutes, and the customer spoke for eight minutes.
* Speaker pace, which is measured by an average number of words spoken per minute.
* Speaker emotions, which was the tone or emotional context of every utterance.
* Auto-generated meeting summary

## Extracting interaction analytics

For the best results we recommend following the guidelines below.

* The `audioType` parameter provides the system with a hint about the nature of the meeting which helps improve accuracy. We recommend setting this parameter to `CallCenter` when there are 2-3 speakers expected to be identified and `Meeting` when 4 or more speakers are expected.

* Set the `enableVoiceActivityDetection` parameter to `True` if you want silence and noise segments removed from the diarization output. We suggest you to set it to `True` in most circumstances.

* Setting the `source` parameter helps to optimize the diarization process by allowing a specialized acoustic model built specifically for the corresponding audio sources.

* If you specify the `speakerIds` parameter, make sure that all the speaker ids in the array exist. Otherwise, the API call will fail. As a good practice, you can always read the speaker ids from your account and use the correct ids of the speakers, who you think that might speak in the audio file.

## Sample code to extract insights of a conversation

The following code sample shows how to extract insights of a conversations from a call recording.

Follow the instructions on the [quick start](quick-start.md) section to setup and run your server code before running the sample code below.

!!! note "Running the code"
    * Edit the variables in ALL CAPS with your app and user credentials before running the code.
    * You can only run on your production account, this means that you have to use app credentials for production.
    * Also make sure that you have recorded several voice recordings of your own voice.
