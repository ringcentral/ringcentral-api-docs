# Text punctuation

The Text Punctuation API takes a list of text blocks and augments them with proper punctuation using artificial intelligence. The same feature is applied to the [speech recognition API's](speech-to-text.md) output if the `enablePunctuation` flag is set. The API will augment text with the following punctuation:

* Periods, full-stop: `.`
* Commas: `,`
* Quotes: `'` `"`
* Question marks: `?`
* Exclamation marks: `!`
* Apostrophes: `'`, contractions and possessive forms
* Proper capitalization, sentence-cap and acronyms
