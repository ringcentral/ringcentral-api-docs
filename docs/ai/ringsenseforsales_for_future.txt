## RingSense for Sales API

The RingSense for Sales API allows you to programmatically access RingSense for Sales data from your account.

The API functions at the account level and requires the "ReadCompanyCallRecording" user permission. This means that any user extension with this permission can access RingSense for Sales data for any user holding a RingSense for Sales license.

There are two methods to access RingSense for Sales data: through push notifications (recommended method) or via a REST API call.

### RingSense for Sales event notification

You can get notified when a new voice call or a new video meeting recording analysis is completed via [RingCentral push notification  service](https://developers.ringcentral.com/guide/notifications). The RingSense for Sales data is included in the event payload together with the event metadata.

To get RingSense for Sales event notification for voice call recordings, subscribe for this event:

`/ai/ringsense/v1/public/accounts/~/domains/pbx/insights`

To get RingSense for Sales event notification for video meeting recordings, subscribe for this event:

`/ai/ringsense/v1/public/accounts/~/domains/rcv/insights`

Remember, the notification events are triggered only if voice calls or video meetings were recorded by users who hold a RingSense for Sales license.

### Read RingSense for Sales data

You can read the RingSense for Sales data of a voice call recording or of a video meeting recording if you know the `sourceRecordId`. The `sourceRecordId` value of a recording is included in the RingSense for Sales event payload.

!!! notes
    * The `sourceRecordId` of a voice call recording is the recording ID of a recorded call. You can get the recording ID of a call from the [call log data](../voice/call-log/details.md).
    * Unfortunately, currently there is no API to detect the `sourceRecordId` of a video meeting recording.

When processing the insights objectsâ€”such as reconstructing conversations using the utterances in the Transcript objects, you can match the speaker ID from a transcript object with the corresponding speaker ID in the `speakerInfo` object. This allows you to display the speaker's name (if available) alongside the utterance text.
