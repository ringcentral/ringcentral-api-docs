# Authorization code flow

RingCentral supports the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, one of the most common authorization methods used by app developers to request and gain access to another user's account via an API. You may see it referred to as a "3-legged authorization flow" because it involves three distinct steps in obtaining an access token used to call the API. Those steps are:

1. Authorization is requested and granted via a user interface.
2. A grant is exchanged for an access token via an API call.
3. The access token is used to call the API to access a protected resource.

!!! hint "Developers are encouraged to implement the nearly identical [PKCE auth code flow](auth-code-pkce-flow.md) for better security."

### What are the benefits of using the authorization code flow?

The auth code flow works to:

* Keep a user's personal login credentials secure, and out of the hands of a third-party.
* Disclose what permissions an app requires.
* Prompt users to explicitly authorize an app to access their data.
* Provide developers with a token that can used to by their applications to act on another user's behalf. 

### When should I use the authorization code flow?

The auth code flow is the most common form of OAuth used on the Internet, and is ideal in the following scenarios:

* Your application is web-based. 
* Your application has a server component capable of receiving HTTP requests from RingCentral.
* Your application exposes a user interface via which users can initiate the login process.
* Your application requires access to a specific user's account.

## Authorization code flow in detail

### Step 1. Compose a "request authorization" URL

The authorization process is initiated by an end user clicking a URL composed by the application requesting access to theirRingCentral account. This URL will contain the following query parameters: 

{! docs/authentication/login-url-params.inc !} 

**Example Login URL**

Below is an example URL to initiate the authorization flow. 

```
https://platform.ringcentral.com/restapi/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=<my_uri>&client_id=<client_id>
```

#### Using an SDK to generate a login URL

We recommend developers use an SDK to generate a login URL to ensure it is composed properly.

=== "Javascript" 

    ```javascript
    {!> code-samples/auth/login-url.js !} 
    ```

### Step 2. User login and consent

On this step your appâ€™s user is redirected by the browser to a RingCentral authorization page, where the user is first asked to login if they have not already.

Once they have logged in, RingCentral will prompt the user with an "Access Request" in which the permissions the app is requesting is disclosed. 

![User Consent](user-consent.png){class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 500px"}

When the user clicks "Authorize," the user is then redirected to the `redirect_uri` that was passed in via the login URL constructed above. At the same time, RingCentral will add the following query parameters to the redirect URI, which your application will need in subsequent steps. 

{! docs/authentication/auth-code-params.inc !} 

!!! warning "For security purposes, the `redirect_uri` must exactly match at least one of the Redirect URIs provided by the developer when the app was created."

#### Example OAuth redirect
	
```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://myapp.example.com/oauth2Callback?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&state=xyz&expires_in=60
```

### Step 3. Exchange auth code for access token
     
The 'code' your application receives at your Redirect URI is a temporary authorization code that is used to obtain an access token to call the API. If the token is not redeemed in the alotted time, the user will need to go through the login and authorization process again. This is the final step in the process before your app can call the RingCentral API. 

To exchange an auth code for an access token, developers will call the RingCentral API accordingly:

**HTTP Headers**

| Header           | Value                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-type`   | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`                        |
| `Authorization`  | `Basic ` + base64_encoded( Client ID + ":" Client Secret ) |

**POST Parameters**

{! docs/authentication/auth-token-params.inc !} 

**Sample Request**

```http
POST /restapi/oauth/token HTTP/1.1 
Accept: application/json 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
Authorization: Basic cmVsLWFsbC1wZXJtaXNzaWXFjMmpRZmlQcnlkSUkweE92QQ==

  &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmyapp.acme.com%2Foauth2redirect
```

#### Auth token response

The server responds with an access token which can presented in subsequent requests in the HTTP Authorization header to authenticate API Calls. The response will contain the following parameters: 

{! docs/authentication/auth-token-response.inc !} 

    
**Sample Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
    
{
   "access_token" : "U1BCMDFUMDRKV1MwMXxzLFSvXdw5PHMsVLEn_MrtcyxUsw",
   "token_type" : "bearer",
   "expires_in" : 7199,
   "refresh_token" : "U1BCMDFUMDRKV1MwMXxzLFL4ec6A0XMsUv9wLriecyxS_w",
   "refresh_token_expires_in" : 604799,
   "scope" : "AccountInfo CallLog ExtensionInfo Messages SMS",
   "owner_id" : "256440016"
}
```

### Step 4. Make your API calls

With an access token in hand, you can now call the API to access the authorizing user's account. The access token is transmitted to the API via the HTTP Authorization header as shown below.

```http
POST /restapi/oauth/token HTTP/1.1 
Accept: application/json 
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer U0pDMTFQMDFQQVMwMXxBQUJfTVpHWk5lM29zNVFm
