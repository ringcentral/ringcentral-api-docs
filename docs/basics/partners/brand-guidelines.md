# RingCentral service provider and partner brand guidelines

This document is provided to RingCentral developers for informational purposes. While RingCentral has agreements with some of our partners to provide a white-labeled or co-branded experience, third-parties are not obligated to these requirements. However, all developers marketing their products within our RingCentral partner ecosystem should be aware of the branding, trademark and other IP requirements these partners may have. 

## Rise partner ecosystem

The Rise partner ecosystem refers to a set of service providers for which RingCentral provides cloud communication services over their backbone, but under the RingCentral brand. Customers affiliated with these partners download and access the same URLs and applications used by RingCentral customers. 

As a result, apps built for RingCentral will automatically be compatible with, and promoted within the main RingCentral App Gallery.

## White-labeled partners

RingCentral has forged strategic relationships with a number of service providers around the world. These partners offer RingCentral-powered cloud communication services under their own brand. While third-parties are not obligated in anyway to co-brand their integrations for these providers, third-party developers should be aware of these partners to optimize their marketing and communications for customers affiliated with them.
