# AT&T Office@Hand Brand and Developer Guidelines

This document is intended for RingCentral ISVs and developers that want to enable their apps for AT&T Office@Hand, leveraging their App for RingCentral MVP™.

## App requirements for AT&T Office@Hand

The doc outlines incremental App requirements to enable for AT&T Office@Hand. It is important to comply with these requirements, in order to qualify your app for AT&T Office@Hand. If you have any questions, please reach out to your RingCentral developer support. As noted above, this doc assumes you have already enabled (or are enabling) RingCentral MVP™ and compliant with its guidelines.

### 1. Technical requirements

AT&T Office@Hand operates within a completed segregated environment within RingCentral. As a result, all API calls made on behalf of AT&T Office@Hand customers must be directed to a different URL. 

Developers must adhere to [additional technical requirements](../segregated-environments/) in order to be compatible with AT&T. Furthermore, developers will be required to demonstrate compliance in order to be listed in the [AT&T Office@Hand app gallery](https://www.ringcentral.com/apps/office-at-hand/). 

### 2. Partner branding and logo

If you use "RingCentral MVP™" branding in your App, replace this with "AT&T Office@Hand" to reference AT&T Office@Hand product.

A sample logo is shown below for AT&T Office@Hand. This logo can be scaled to the appropriate pixel dimensions in your App.

### 3. Countries support

AT&T Office@Hand is now supported in United States, UK, Canada and 11 EU countries, including Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy. 

Your App needs to be supported in the United States to qualify for AT&T Office@Hand integration. Additionally AT&T has restrictions on presence or support operation in China, Russia, and Ukraine. 

Additional countries will be introduced on a quarterly basis which may require specific application support and/or language support to remain eligible for those countries.

### 4. Language Support

AT&T Office@Hand supports US English as the base line. Your App needs to support this language and localization. Additionally, UK English, Canadian French, French French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Dutch are supported languages and localization for non-US countries.

As additional regional coverages are introduced on a quarterly basis, additional language support may be required to remain eligible.


### 5. Providing end-user support

You need to set up customer support for AT&T Office@Hand customers, leveraging support model you have set up for RingCentral customers. Your app-specific support for AT&T Office@Hand customers should be handled by your support team. Where customers need additional AT&T Office@Hand account specific support, you may route these support requests to your existing RingCentral support channel. Specifically note/tag "AT&T Office@Hand" in your support requests, so it handled appropriately within RingCentral.

### Partner test accounts
