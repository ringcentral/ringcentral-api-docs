## Getting listed in the RingCentral App Gallery

We recommend you get started by successfully creating and publishing an App Gallery Profile for the official RingCentral App Gallery. Let's begin. Login to the RingCentral Developer Console, then from your list of application, select the one you would lik to promote, and then click the "Promote" tab. Then follow these steps. 

### Create an app gallery profile

You will see a list of all the app galleries your app is able to be promoted within.

??? tip "Don't see the app gallery you are looking for?"
    The list of app gallery profiles you are able to create is dependent upon what partners you enabled your app for when it was created. Unfortunately you cannot edit this list yourself after the app is created. Reach out to our [Developer Support](mailto:devsupport@ringcentral.com) for help is modifying the list of partners your app is available to. 

### Tell us about your app

After you click the "Start" button you will taken to a page where you can tell us more about your application. This information is used not only to render your app gallery profile, but our partner and marketing teams also consult this information to inform how best to promote your app within internal channels.

Click "Save as draft" to save your work and come back later to finish. When you are finished, click "Submit for approval" to continue on to the next step. 

??? tip "Save and preview often"
    Be sure to save your app profile often as you go, and to preview it to see what it will look like when it goes live. This will help you create a profile that is complete, and looks good. We recommend partners pay close attention to the following:
    * Upload or link to a video that shows your product in action.
    * Upload a number of detailed screenshots.
    * Provide us with sufficient content for the Support and Installation areas.

### Submit your application for review

Before your app can be listed in an app gallery, the RingCentral team will first review your app and will make recommendations to help you improve your app profile to better reach our customer base.

Upon clicking "Submit for approval" you will be asked when you would like your profile to be published, and you will be asked to review our best practices and re-accept our API Terms of Service.
