# Making Calls Using RingOut

The RingOut option enables the users to make a call from any other outside number (not RingCentral number) by means of the RingCentral account, when it is not convenient for them to use the RingCentral number. This feature is available for softphone, web service and mobile applications.

The user specifies a certain number under the forwarding number list, starts RingOut and enters the required called number. RingCentral makes a call to the specified forwarding number and connects the user with the called number.

The API treats a two-legged RingOut call as a resource that can be created, retrieved, or deleted via the `POST`, `GET` and `DELETE` methods correspondingly.

## Sample Code to Get Started with RingOut

The two-legged RingOut call can be created via the following request:

=== "HTTP"

	```http
	POST /restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/ring-out
	Content-Type: application/json
	Authorization: Bearer <access-token>

	{
	    "from": {"phoneNumber": "13445554444"}, /* from parameter is optional if there is a default number in user's forwarding numbers */
	    "to": {"phoneNumber": "13455553434"}, /* to parameter is required */
	    "playPrompt": true /* optional field */
	}
	```

=== "Javascript"

	```javascript
    {!> code-samples/voice/quick-start.js [ln:1-38]!}
	```

=== "Python"

	```python
    {!> code-samples/voice/quick-start.py [ln:1-41]!}
	```

=== "PHP"

	```php
    {!> code-samples/voice/quick-start.php [ln:1-45]!}
	```

=== "C#"

	```c#
    {!> code-samples/voice/Call_RingOut/Program.cs !}
	```

=== "Java"

	```java
    {!> code-samples/java-samples/src/main/java/com/ringcentral/RingoutQuickStart.java !}
	```

=== "Ruby"

	```ruby
    {!> code-samples/voice/quick-start.rb [ln:1-43]!}
	```

## Request parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `from`    | Refers to the number of the calling party. Required field only if there is no default number in the user's forwarding number list. The phoneNumber attribute should comply with the E.164 standard. As a result of validation of the phoneNumber attribute the server may return the error code: 400 Bad Request - phoneNumber specified in the field is empty or invalid. |
| `to` | Refers to the called party number. Required field. If this field is missing from the request, the 400 Bad Request error is returned. The phoneNumber attribute should comply with the E.164 standard. As a result of validation of the phoneNumber attribute the server may return the error code: 400 Bad Request - phoneNumber specified in the field is empty or invalid. |
| `playPrompt` | The audio prompt that the calling party hears when the call is connected. Optional field. It corresponds to the setting in the RingCentral application "Prompt me to dial 1 before connecting" (When selected, the system will ask you to press "1" on your phone's key pad before connecting to the destination number). |

## Example response

The response can be as follows:

```json
{!> code-samples/voice/ringout-response.json !}
```

Call status is generated as a combination of both call legs statuses (caller and callee):

Caller or Callee statuses are separately generated for the target call party:

## RingOut Flow

See how the statuses are changing during successful call on the flowchart below:

## How to check on the status of a RingOut call in progress

You can poll the RingOut endpoint to get the status of an ongoing outbound RingOut call.

    GET /restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/ring-out/234343434

The response will be similar to the following:

```json
{!> code-samples/voice/ringout-poll-response.json !}
```

## How to cancel a RingOut in progress

RingCentral does not currently support call control for outbound calls. However, you can cancel a RingOut call while the callee's party status is `InProgress` by making a `DELETE` request to the RingOut endpoint as shown below:

```
DELETE /restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/ring-out/234343434
```

If successful, the platform will respond with a 204.

Deleting the RingOut is only available when the RingOut has been initiated and the call has not yet been connected. For example, if you initiate a RingOut and immediately call the DELETE RingOut endpoint, the call would get terminated as long as the RingOut between the two parties is not connected (first leg has not been established). If the first leg of the call has been initiated, then the DELETE API will not terminate the call.

## Setting the caller ID for RingOut calls

The `/ring-out` API allows developers to specify the caller ID in the API request body. To do this, developers should first identify the [user's phone numbers](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Phone-Numbers/listExtensionPhoneNumbers) that support the `CallerId` feature, and then select one of those numbers to use as the caller ID.

If the `callerId` parameter is not specified, the API will use the default caller ID which is normally the main company phone number. The default caller ID for a ring out call can be changed from the [RingCentral admin portal](https://service.ringcentral.com)
