# Call Log Best Practices

As you develop applications and integrations with the Call Log resource, there are certain concerns which may arise that you may/may not be aware of which have serious development, business, and/or user-experience considerations.

* Throttling Call Log Requests Properly
* HIPAA Considerations while Developing with Call Log

Each of the above items has different impact depending upon the current needs of the developer.

## Throttling Call Log Requests Properly

In any language, you can interpret the response headers to determine how to properly throttle your Call Log Requests.

RingCentral will respond (from any request to Call Log) the following headers to help guide you:

1. X-Rate-Limit-Group: A string representing the Usage Plan for the requested resource
2. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: While a little redundant in naming (LOL), shows you how many requests you are permitted in the current Usage Plan within the X-Rate-Limit-Window header value
3. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: A number representing the amount of requests you have remaining in the X-Rate-Limit-Window from your initial request (the Date header of your first request)
4. X-Rate-Limit-Window: The amount (in seconds) you are able to execute the maximum (X-Rate-Limit-Limit) number of requests

Turning this into a simple algorithm, we could do the following (in pseudo-JS code)

```
var initialRequestTimeStamp = +new Date();
var limitMax = initialRequestTimeStamp + 60000);

while(+new Date() < limitMax) {
    if( headers['X-Rate-Limit-Remaining] > 0 ) {
        executeNextRequest(params);
    } else {
        setTimeout(executeRequest(params), 60000);
    }
}
```

The above may not be perfect, but it does get your head thinking in the right direction. If you have a better way to do this, submit a PR to this repository and we will include it after testing.


## HIPAA Considerations While Developing with Call Log

RingCentral offers HIPAA-Compliant services to customers that require it. HIPAA-Compliant accounts do not have SMS ability (because SMS is not currently HIPAA-Compliant) as a communication channel.

As a developer, it is YOUR responsibility to consider the best implications for HIPAA-Compliance in your application and integrations.

For Example: Thinking about making an application which allows the ability to email transcription of a call recording or call recording binary data....we would instead recommend that you email a time-sensitive link back to your application which requires authentication by a RingCentral user in that account to access that data.

Be mindful of how multiple customer types will use your application or integration and keep HIPAA-Compliance as a "top-of-mind" aspect to your development.
