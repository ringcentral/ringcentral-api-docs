# Call Forwarding and Call Flipping

Call Forwarding allows incoming phone calls to be directed to another phone number. This is handy when recipients have multiple phone numbers and/or a physical phone at which they can be reached. There are two primary ways calls are directed to other phones/numbers:

* **Call Forwarding** applies to incoming calls, and allows those calls to ring at one or more numbers sequentially or simultaneously.

* **Call Flipping** applies to active calls, and allows a speaker to instantly transfer an active call to another phone or device without having to terminate the call.

## Phone Types

| Type | Description |
|-|-|
| PhoneLine | This refers to a RingCentral device or hard-phone. When specifying this type when creating/registering a new call forwarding number, the developer must also specify the device id (see [API Reference](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Call-Forwarding/createForwardingNumber)). |
| Home | Home phone number. |
| Mobile | Mobile phone number. |
| Work | Work phone number. |
| Other | A phone number of any other type. |

## Create a Forwarding Number

To create a forwarding number:

* Specify the `phoneNumber` parameter. This is a phone number for an incoming call to be forwarded to.
* Specify `type` parameter using one of the type's value from the table above. The default value is "Other"
* Specify the `label` (title of the forwarding number object) parameter if the `type` is omitted or specified as "Other".
* Specify the `id` for the `device` object if the `type` is specified as "PhoneLine".
* Make a POST request to `/restapi/v1.0/account/{accountId}/extension/{extensionId}/forwarding-number` endpoint.

!!! Important
    The `label` will be ignored if the `type` value is different than "Other"!

    The `phoneNumber` cannot be any direct number of any extension under the same account!

    The `device` parameter cannot be specified together with the `phoneNumber`!

    A list of valid device ids can be retrieved by calling the [Get Extension Device List API](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Devices/listExtensionDevices).

### Sample code to create a forwarding number object

The following code sample shows how to create a forwarding number object. The `id` value from the response can be used to specify a rule when [creating a custom answering rule](user-answering-rules.md).

## Read all Forwarding Numbers

To read all forwarding numbers:

* Make a GET request to `/restapi/v1.0/account/{accountId}/extension/{extensionId}/forwarding-number` endpoint.

Required permission(s): ReadExtensions

Upon successful API call completion, the response contains a list of predefined forwarding numbers

## Read a Forwarding Number

To read a forwarding number:

* Make a GET request to `/restapi/v1.0/account/{accountId}/extension/{extensionId}/forwarding-number/[forwardingNumberId]` endpoint, where the `forwardingNumberId` is the id of an existing forwarding number object.

!!! Hint
    A valid `forwardingNumberId` can be retrieved using the previous API to read all forwarding numbers.

}
```

## Update a Forwarding Number

To update an existing forwarding number:

* Specify the [parameters](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Call-Forwarding/updateForwardingNumber) which need to be updated.
* Make a PUT request to `/restapi/v1.0/account/{accountId}/extension/{extensionId}/forwarding-number/[forwardingNumberId]` endpoint, where the `forwardingNumberId` is the id of an existing forwarding number object.

!!! Hint
    A valid `forwardingNumberId` can be retrieved using the previous API to read all forwarding numbers.
