# Company Answering Rules

Company Answering Rules can be used to create and manage the logic for routing calls through IVR menus, as well as routing calls to extensions that not directly associated with an individual user. For example, the following are all extension types for which Company Answering Rules would be appropriate:

* Call Queues
* Department Groups
* IVR Menu Extensions

If you are unfamiliar with answering rules, we recommend you read our [Answering Rules Overview](answering-rules.md).

## Creating a Company Custom Answering Rule

Be mindful of the following when constructing a request to create a user custom answering rule:

* Provide a meaningful name for the rule using the `name` parameter.
* Set the `type` parameter as "Custom."
* Set the `enabled` parameter to True if the rule needs to be in effect immediately. Otherwise, set it to False.
* Specify one or more conditions (see below).
* Specify the action to take using the `callHandlingAction` field (see table below).
* Specify the `extension` and `greetings` parameters. [More details](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Rule-Management/createCompanyAnsweringRule)

Finally, make a POST request to the following endpoint:

`/restapi/v1.0/account/{accountId}/extension/{extensionId}/answering-rule`

### Call Handling Actions

| Action | Description |
|-|-|
| `Operator` | Play company greeting and forward to an operator extension. |
| `Disconnect` | Play back company greeting then hangup. |
| `Bypass` | Skip company greeting and forward to a selected extension. |

### Call Handling Conditions

The following parameters are used for specifying call handling conditions.

* `callers`: a list of callers' phone numbers or contact names
    * `callerId`:
    * `name`:
* `calledNumbers`:  a list of recipients' phone numbers
    * `phoneNumber`: a phone number belonging to the user/extension
* `schedule`: week day and time or time ranges or business hours and after hours parameters
    * `weeklyRanges`: week day and time ranges
    * `ranges`: date and time ranges
    * `ref`: "BusinessHours" or "AfterHours". Business hours can be set using the [Business Hours API Reference](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Business-Hours/updateUserBusinessHours)
