# Call Queue Call Handling

Call queue call handling is a set of configurations that determine how incoming calls to a call queue are routed and managed. These configurations can be tailored for different scenarios to ensure efficient call distribution and a consistent caller experience.

<img class="img-fluid" src="../../../../img/callqueue-callhandling.png">

Call queue call handling rules can be defined separately based on the following conditions:

- Business Hours rule – Defines how calls are managed during the preset operating hours.
- After Hours rule – Applies when the business is closed (if business hours are not set to 24/7).
- Custom Schedules and Conditions rule  – Allows for special rules based on specific criteria, such as caller ID, called number, or custom time schedules (e.g., holidays or special events).

If a call queue has a custom rule that is configured and enabled, any incoming call to the queue will first be evaluated against the conditions defined in that rule. If all the conditions are met, the call will be routed according to the dispatching settings specified in the rule.

When multiple custom rules are active, the system will evaluate each rule in order. The first rule whose conditions match will determine how the call is handled. If none of the active custom rules match the incoming call, the system will fall back to evaluating the call against the Business Hours or After Hours rule, depending on the current date and time.

Call queue call handling configurations are set differently for different types of rules.

## Business Hours rule

The Business Hours rule defines how incoming calls are handled during the organization's regular working hours. This rule ensures calls are routed to the available members (agents) when they are expected to be on duty. This rule typically aligns with the operating hours of the company or a specific branch office, helping to maintain a consistent and responsive customer experience.

The Business Hours call handling configurations are complex. They include a set of configurations for ringing its members and other call queue features such as the waiting time, agent time out or the forwarding actions when the incoming call is not answered.

**Answering configurations**

Answering configurations define how a call queue distributes incoming calls to its members. There are three available call distribution modes:

  - Simultaneous – All available members' phones ring at the same time. The first member to answer handles the call.
  - Fixed Order – Calls are routed to members one at a time in a predefined sequence. If the first member doesn’t answer within the set timeout, the system tries the next member in the list, and so on.
  - Longest Idle – The call is directed to the member who has been idle (i.e., available without taking a call) for the longest period.

**Forwarding configurations**

1. When the queue is full
    - Send to Voicemail - Can be the call queue's own voicemail or another extension's voicemail
    - Play Announcement - Play a prerecorded message
    - Forward to extension - Any type of extension (IVR menu, call queue, user etc.)
    - Forward to external number (Unconditional Forwarding) - Any phone number

2. When the maximum wait time is reached
    - Send to Voicemail - Can be the call queue's own voicemail or another extension's voicemail
    - Forward to extension - Any type of extension (IVR menu, call queue, user etc.)
    - Forward to external number (Unconditional Forwarding) - Any phone number

3. When no one answers
    - WaitPrimaryMembers - Keep waiting for the queue's members to answer the incoming call.
    - WaitPrimaryAndOverflowMembers - Rings members from the overflow group (other call queue) if overflow group was selected.
    - Send to Voicemail - Can be the call queue's own voicemail or another extension's voicemail.
    - Forward to extension - Any type of extension (IVR menu, call queue, user etc.).
    - Forward to external number (Unconditional Forwarding) - Any phone number.

## After Hours rule

The After Hours rule manages call behavior outside of regular business hours. When the office is closed, this rule reroutes calls to voicemail, plays a recorded message, or forwards them to an alternate destination such as another call queue or a mobile number. It ensures that callers are still acknowledged and provided with relevant information or next steps, even when call queue members are unavailable.

The After Hours rule can be configured to forward incoming calls to the following destinations:

- Send to Voicemail - Can be the call queue's own voicemail or another extension's voicemail
- Play Announcement - Play a prerecorded message
- Forward to extension - Any type of extension (IVR menu, call queue, user)
- Forward to external number (Unconditional Forwarding) - Any phone number

## Custom rule

Custom rules allow for flexible and tailored call handling based on specific conditions such as holidays, lunch breaks, special campaigns, or unexpected closures. These rules can override both business and after-hours rules to support unique scheduling or routing needs.

A custom rule can be configured to forward incoming calls to the following destinations:

- Ring call queue members
- Send to Voicemail - Can be the call queue's own voicemail or another extension's voicemail
- Play Announcement - Play a prerecorded message
- Forward to extension - Any type of extension (IVR menu, call queue, user etc.)
- Forward to external number (Unconditional Forwarding) - Any phone number


## Update Call Queue Business Hour and After Hour Call Handling Rules

By default, the system automatically creates a Business Hours rule and, if business hours are not set to 24/7, an After Hours rule. These rules are assigned the IDs `business-hours-rule` and `after-hours-rule`, respectively.

Developers can only update these rules configurations by making a PUT request to the following API endpoint, replacing [ruleId] with the appropriate rule identifier:

```http
PUT /restapi/v1.0/account/~/answering-rule/[ruleId]
```

## Creating a Call queue Custom Call Handling Rule

Be mindful of the following when constructing a request to create a company custom answering rule:

* Provide a meaningful name for the rule using the `name` parameter.
* Set the `type` parameter as "Custom."
* Set the `enabled` parameter to True if the rule needs to be in effect immediately. Otherwise, set it to False.
* Specify one or more conditions (see below).
* Specify the action to take using the `callHandlingAction` field (see table below).
* Specify the `extension` and `greetings` parameters. [More details](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Call-Handling-Rules/createCompanyAnsweringRule)

Finally, make a POST request to the following endpoint:

`/restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/[CallQueueExtensionId]/answering-rule`

### Call Handling Actions

| Action | Description |
|-|-|
| `ForwardCalls` | Forward calls to an external number. |
| `UnconditionalForwarding` | Forward calls to an external number. |
| `AgentQueue` |  |
| `TransferToExtension` |  |
| `TakeMessageOnly` |  |
| `PlayAnnouncementOnly` |  |

### Call Handling Conditions

The following parameters are used for specifying call handling conditions.

* `callers`: a list of callers' phone numbers or contact names
    * `callerId`:
    * `name`:
* `calledNumbers`:  a list of recipients' phone numbers
    * `phoneNumber`: a phone number belonging to the user/extension
* `schedule`: week day and time or time ranges or business hours and after hours parameters
    * `weeklyRanges`: week day and time ranges
    * `ranges`: date and time ranges
    * `ref`: "BusinessHours" or "AfterHours". Business hours can be set using the [Business Hours API Reference](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-reference/Business-Hours/updateUserBusinessHours)
