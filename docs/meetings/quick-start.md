# Meetings Quick Start

{! mdx_includes/rcm-deprecation-notice.md !}

??? check "Paid RingCentral account and Meetings app scope required"
     In order to use this API, developers must have a paid RingCentral account. This API is not available to free developer accounts.
	 In addition, applications that call this API require the "Meetings" application scope. To have this scope added to your application, please [contact developer support](https://developers.ringcentral.com/support/create-case).

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you creating a meeting on the platform in just a few minutes. Let's get started.

## Create an app and obtain credentials

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Console. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Meetings App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "REST API App" under "What type of app are you creating?" Click "Next."</li>
<li>Under "Auth" select "JWT auth flow."
<li>Under "Security" select "This app is private and will only be callable using credentials from the same RingCentral account."</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Request help from support

Access to the RingCentral Meetings API currently requires help from support in order to grant the "Meetings" application scope to your application.
