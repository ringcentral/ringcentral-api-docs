# Meetings PHP Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you create your first meeting on the platform in just a few minutes. Let's get started.

!!! warning "Meetings Permission Required"
     In order to use this API, developers must have a paid RingCentral account. This API is not available to free developer accounts.

## Create an App

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Meetings App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "Office Integration App" under "What type of app are you creating?"</li>
<li>Select "Other Non-UI" under "Where will you be calling the API from?"
<li>Select "Only members of my organization/company" under "Who will be authorized to access your app?"
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard, enter your app's name and description. Then select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>Meetings</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Create a Meeting

### Install RingCentral PHP SDK

```php
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar require ringcentral/ringcentral-php
```

### Create and Edit meetings.php

Create a file called `meeting.php`. Be sure to edit the variables in ALL CAPS with your app and user credentials. Be sure to also set the recipient's phone number.

```PHP
<?php
require('vendor/autoload.php');

$RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID = '<ENTER CLIENT ID>';
$RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET = '<ENTER CLIENT SECRET>';
$RINGCENTRAL_SERVER = 'https://platform.ringcentral.com';

$RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME = '<YOUR ACCOUNT PHONE NUMBER>';
$RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD = '<YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD>';
$RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION = '<YOUR EXTENSION, PROBABLY "101">';

$rcsdk = new RingCentral\SDK\SDK($RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID, $RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET, $RINGCENTRAL_SERVER);

$platform = $rcsdk->platform();
$platform->login($RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME, $RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION, $RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD);

$params = array(
    'topic' => 'Test Meeting',
    'meetingType' => 'Instant',
    'allowJoinBeforeHost' => true,
    'startHostVideo' => true,
    'startParticipantsVideo' => false
    );
try {
  $resp = $platform->post('/account/~/extension/~/meeting', $params);
  print_r ('Start Your Meeting: ' . $resp->json()->links->startUri . "\n");
  print_r ('Join the Meeting: ' . $resp->json()->links->joinUri . "\n");
} catch (Exception $e) {
  print_r ("An error occurred: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n");
}
```

### Run Your Code

You are almost done. Now run your script.

```bash
$ php meetings.php
```
